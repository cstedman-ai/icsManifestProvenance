# Problem Statement: Current Provenance and Reconciliation of Procured Items

**Author:** Frank D'Arrigo

## Summary

The receiving process is manual, slow, and error-prone. Too many hand-off points introduce human mistakes that compromise compliance-critical documentation. The core need is a streamlined system that improves three things:

1. **Efficiency** — Eliminate redundant manual steps in receiving and document handling.
2. **Accuracy** — Reduce the points where human error can corrupt or lose data.
3. **Storage & Compliance** — Ensure packing lists and proof-of-receipt documents are digitally captured, centrally stored, and audit-ready.

There are too many points in the process that manual errors can occur. 
The problem is we need a way to streamline the efficiency, accuracy and storage of these important documents to ensure compliance
