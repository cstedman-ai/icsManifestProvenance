# **Standard Packing Slip, Packing List & Commercial Invoice Requirements**

As part of CoreWeave’s logistics and compliance requirements, all vendors must 

provide complete and accurate packing slip, packing list, and (for international shipments) commercial invoice information once goods are fully packed and staged for transport.

These details are mandatory for shipment approval and are required to enable accurate carrier selection, freight booking, delivery scheduling, and (where applicable) customs clearance.

---

## **1\. Mandatory Packing Slip Content**

Every shipment to CoreWeave must include a printed, legible packing slip that is placed inside one carton and, where possible, also attached to the outside of the master carton.

At a minimum, the packing slip must contain:

### 1.1 Shipment-Level Information

* CoreWeave PO Number  
  * If the shipment covers multiple CoreWeave POs, clearly list each PO number and group all line items under the corresponding PO.

### 1.2 Line-Item Information (for each SKU shipped)

For each item shipped, the packing slip must list:

* CoreWeave Friendly SKU   
  * ( Use the CoreWeave SKU exactly as shown on the PO.)  
* Manufacturer’s Part Number (MPN) *(if applicable)*   
  * If there is no MPN, clearly indicate “N/A”.  
* Quantity Shipped :   
  * Quantity shipped per CoreWeave Friendly SKU per PO.  
* **Serial Number(s) Associated with the CoreWeave Friendly SKU (if applicable)**  
  * List all serial numbers shipped for that SKU.  
  * Serial numbers may be provided in one of the following ways: · Included directly on the packing slip, or  
  * Provided on an attached serial number list that clearly references:  
  * CoreWeave PO Number  
  * CoreWeave Friendly SKU  
  * Manufacturer’s Part Number, or  
  * **For single‑SKU freight pallets only:** encoded in a 2D barcode label applied to the pallet, provided that: · The 2D barcode meets the Pallet Identification & 2D Barcode Requirements in Section 4 of this document; and  
  * The packing slip / packing list clearly references the **Pallet ID** associated with each set of serial numbers.

Shipments missing any of the above information may be delayed in receiving and put-away while CoreWeave reconciles the data.

---

## **2\. Packed Dimensions & Weight Requirements (Packing List)**

In addition to the packing slip content above, vendors must provide accurate packed dimensions and weights for the shipment as tendered to the carrier.

The packing list must include:

* Packed dimensions  
  * Length × Width × Height for each packed unit  
  * Units may be in inches or centimeters.  
* Packed weight  
  * Net shipping weight for each packed unit  
  * Units may be in pounds or kilograms.

The above packed dimensions and weights must meet the following standards:

1. Include all packaging materials  
   * Measurements must reflect the item as shipped, including:  
     * Boxes and cartons  
     * Crates and protective foams  
     * Pallets and any outer containers  
2. Match the final shipment configuration  
   * Data must match how the freight is actually tendered (e.g., single cartons vs. palletized loads, mixed pallets, etc.).  
3. Mixed or multiple units  
   * If there are multiple items, mixed pallets, or different pack configurations, specify the packed dimensions and weight for each distinct unit or shipment grouping (e.g., each carton, each pallet, each crate).  
4. Format & submission  
   * Provide this information as part of the official packing list attached to the shipment documentation.  
   * Share the completed packing list with CoreWeave prior to dispatch and transport scheduling.  
5. Discrepancies  
   * Any discrepancies between product net specifications and actual packed shipping details must be:  
     * Identified and flagged immediately, and  
     * Resolved with CoreWeave before pickup is scheduled.

## **3\. Commercial Invoice Requirements for International Shipments**

For all international, cross-border shipments (including returns, RMAs, and no-charge replacements), vendors must provide a commercial invoice in addition to the packing slip and packing list.

The commercial invoice must include, at minimum:

* Exporter / Shipper details  
  * Full legal name, address, and contact information.  
* Consignee and delivery details  
  * CoreWeave legal entity, delivery address, and contact (as provided on the PO or shipping instructions).  
* CoreWeave PO Number(s)  
  * Reference all relevant CoreWeave POs and align line items to the PO where applicable.

* Total invoice value  
  * Currency, subtotal, freight and insurance (if charged), and grand total.  
* Reason for export  
  * For example: “Sale”, “Return for repair”, “RMA – no commercial value”, or “Warranty replacement – no charge”.

Additional handling requirements:

* Provide the commercial invoice electronically to CoreWeave and/or the designated freight forwarder or customs broker prior to pickup, to enable customs pre‑clearance.  
* Include at least one physical copy of the commercial invoice in a document pouch on the outside of the lead carton or crate.  
* Ensure all values, quantities, and descriptions on the commercial invoice match the packing slip and packing list. Any differences must be resolved with CoreWeave before the shipment is dispatched.

# **4\. Pallet Identification & 2D Barcode Requirements**

To improve inbound receiving accuracy, serial number capture, and traceability across multi‑pallet deliveries, CoreWeave requires standardized pallet identification and 2D barcode labeling for freight shipments.

### 4.1 Scope

* These requirements apply to all palletized freight shipments to any CoreWeave facility.  
* 2D barcode labeling is mandatory for single‑SKU freight pallets.  
* Pallet identification (Pallet ID / pallet number) is mandatory for all multi‑pallet shipments, regardless of whether pallets are single‑SKU or mixed‑SKU.

### 

### 4.2 Pallet Identification (Pallet ID / Pallet Number)

* For all shipments that include more than one pallet: · The vendor must assign a **unique Pallet ID** (pallet number) to each physical pallet in the shipment  
* The Pallet ID must be: · Unique within the shipment,  
  Alphanumeric, and  
* Printed clearly on the pallet label in human‑readable text.  
  The **packing list** must: · List each Pallet ID, and  
* Show the SKUs and quantities associated with each Pallet ID (carton‑to‑pallet mapping where applicable).  
* For international shipments, Pallet IDs should also be visible to support reconciliation with the commercial invoice and packing list during customs clearance.

### 4.3 2D Barcode Requirements for Single‑SKU Freight Pallets

For every **single‑SKU freight pallet**, the vendor must apply at least one 2D barcode label (e.g., QR Code or Data Matrix) that encodes, at minimum: · 

* Pallet ID (pallet number)  
* CoreWeave PO Number  
* CoreWeave Friendly SKU (exactly as shown on the PO)  
* Manufacturer’s Part Number (MPN), or “N/A” if not applicable  
* Total quantity of the SKU on that pallet  
* **All serial numbers** for the units placed on that pallet

Additional requirements: 

The 2D barcode must be scannable using standard handheld scanners commonly used in warehouse environments.

* If character limits require, serial numbers may be encoded as a structured list or range, provided the encoding unambiguously maps each serial number to that pallet.  
  · The human‑readable pallet label must include, at a minimum:   
  * Pallet ID  
  * CoreWeave PO Number  
  * CoreWeave Friendly SKU  
  * Quantity on pallet

### 4.4 Label Placement & Quality

Place the pallet label (with human‑readable text and 2D barcode) on at least **two adjacent sides** of the pallet, at a height that is easily scannable from ground level.  
Labels must be Securely affixed to the stretch‑wrap or outer packaging,Not obstructed by band-ing, corner boards, or other packaging materials, and Printed with sufficient contrast and resolution to ensure reliable scanning.

### 4.5 Alignment with Packing Slip and Packing List

Pallet IDs used on pallet labels must **match exactly** the Pallet IDs listed on the packing slip and packing list. Where serial numbers are provided via 2D barcode for single‑SKU pallets, the packing slip or attached serial number list must: 

* Clearly reference the corresponding Pallet ID, and  
* Indicate that serial numbers for that pallet are encoded in the 2D barcode label

Shipments that do not meet these pallet identification and 2D barcode standards may experience delays in receiving and put‑away while CoreWeave reconciles data and manually captures serial numbers.

### **5\. Unit & Carton Labeling Requirements**

To ensure accurate receiving, inventory control, and serial number capture, all vendors must apply standardized labels to each **unit**, **inner carton**, and **master carton** shipped to CoreWeave (where applicable).

#### **5.1 Required Human‑Readable Information**

Each applicable label must, at minimum, include:

* **CoreWeave PO Number**

  * Use the PO number exactly as shown on the CoreWeave purchase order.  
* **CoreWeave Friendly SKU**

  * Use the CoreWeave SKU exactly as shown on the PO.  
* **Manufacturer’s Part Number (MPN)**

  * If no MPN exists, clearly print “N/A”.  
* **Serial Number (SN)** (where applicable)

  * For serialized products, print the full serial number exactly as it appears in your internal system.  
  * If multiple units are contained in a single carton, clearly indicate whether the printed serial number represents:  
    * A single unit within the carton, or  
    * A range / list of serial numbers included in that carton (if used).

#### **5.2 Serial Number Barcode Requirements**

For serialized products, the serial number must also be provided in barcode form on the unit and/or carton label:

* **Barcode type**

  * Preferred: **Code 128 (1D)** or **Data Matrix / QR (2D)** symbology that is commonly supported by warehouse handheld scanners.  
* **Encoded data**

  * Encode **only the serial number** by default (no additional text, prefixes, or suffixes), unless a different format has been explicitly approved in writing by CoreWeave Logistics.  
  * Each serialized unit must have a **unique** serial number and corresponding barcode.  
* **Human‑readable text**

  * The serial number must appear in clear human‑readable text directly above or below the barcode.  
* **Print quality**

  * Labels must be printed with sufficient contrast and resolution to ensure reliable scanning in standard warehouse conditions.

Note: Pallet‑level 2D barcode requirements (including encoding of serial numbers at pallet level) are defined separately in **Section 4 – Pallet Identification & 2D Barcode Requirements**. Unit and carton labels must not conflict with the pallet labels and associated Pallet IDs.

#### **5.3 Label Placement**

* Place labels on a **flat, visible surface** of the unit/carton that is easily accessible for scanning and inspection on receipt.  
* Do not place labels:  
  * Over seams, closures, or edges that may be cut or damaged during opening, or  
  * On removable protective films or surfaces that are likely to be discarded.  
* For master cartons, place labels on at least **one long side** of the carton. For heavy or large cartons, placing on **two adjacent sides** is recommended.

#### **5.4 Mixed Contents & Exceptions**

* For **mixed‑SKU cartons** (where multiple SKUs or serial numbers are packed together), the carton label must either:  
  * Clearly list all contained CoreWeave SKUs and serial numbers, or  
  * Refer to an **attached serial number list** that maps:  
    * CoreWeave PO Number  
    * CoreWeave Friendly SKU  
    * Manufacturer’s Part Number  
    * Serial numbers contained in that carton.  
* Any exceptions to these labeling requirements must be:  
  * **Requested in advance** and  
  * **Approved in writing** by CoreWeave Global Logistics Operations.
